# Interview-Prep

This repository reflects my practice on Interview style problems from websites such as AlgoExpert, Leetcode, HackerRank, etc. 

I plan to do one problem daily, and upload my code here. The problems are grouped by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard). The categories of problems are:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees
- Famous Algorithms
- Graphs
- Heaps
- Stacks
- Sorting/Searching
- Recursion

Thanks for reading, enjoy!
